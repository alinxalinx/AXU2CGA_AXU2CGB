# Xilinx Zynq Ultrascale+ MPSoC Series Development Board AXU2CGA/AXU2CGB

## Introduction to Development Board

The PS side of the AXU2CGA mounts two DDR4 chips (totaling 1GB, 32bit) and one 256Mb QSPI FLASH. The PS side of the AXU2CGB mounts four DDR4 chips (totaling 2GB, 64bit), one 8GB eMMC FLASH memory chip, and one 256Mb FLASH memory chip
The peripheral interface of QSPI FLASH includes 1 MINI DP interface, 4 USB 3.0 interfaces, 1 Gigabit Ethernet interface, 1 USB serial port, 1 PCIE interface, 1 TF card interface, 2 40-pin expansion ports, 2 MIPI interfaces, and key LEDs. Both development boards use XCZU2CG-1SFVC784E chips.

# AXU2CGA/AXU2CGB Demo Project
## Description
This is vivado factory demo project for ALINX board.
## Requirement
* Vivado 2020.1
* AXU2CGA/AXU2CGB Development Board
## Create Vivado Project
* Download recent release ZIP archive.
* Create new project folder.
* Extract the download ZIP to the new project folder.
* For different development board, please open **\<archive extracted location\>/vivado/auto_create_project/create_project.tcl**ï¼Œ line 6 or 7,
Choose one projName and save.


There are two methods to create vivado project as below:
### Create Vivado Project in Vivado tcl console
1. Open Vivado software and switch to "**auto_create_project**" path with **cd** command and **Enter**
```
cd \<archive extracted location\>/vivado/auto_create_project
```
2. Type **source ./create_project.tcl** and **Enter**
```
source ./create_project.tcl
```

### Create Vivado Project using bat
1. In "**auto_create_project**" folder, there is "**create_project.bat**", open it in edit mode, and change to your own vivado software installation path. Save and close.
```
CALL E:\XilinxVitis\Vivado\2020.1\bin\vivado.bat -mode batch -source create_project.tcl
PAUSE
```
2. Double click bat file in Windows environment
